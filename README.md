# SonyJogShuttleButton
Sample 15 possible speeds and Stop and Play from a Sony VCR button, then TX results over UART

Was written for the typical Atmega 328P(U) with the typical 16MHz bootloader.

Works with a button pulled from a Sony VCR Remote where left to right (button orientation up) leads are:
Play, Vcc, Stop, Vcc, and 4 pins for dial speed.
